# Demonstration

This doc is to show what I can show in terms of where the tool is at.

Currently, we have a single backend endpoint, `/links` that takes a request containing:
```
{
    "text": "text to be translated",
    "languages": [
        "array",
        "of",
        "different",
        "languages"
    ]
}
```
which returns pregenerated twitter search links, i.e. `https://twitter.com/search?q=Cherso≈Ñ&src=typed_query&f=live`.

![Example request and response](docs/media/request.png)

These links are sufficient to launch twitter, presuming users are logged in, to search for the latest tweets with that text.

## Extension

![Extension loaded in chrome](docs/media/extension.png)

To demo the extension is harder as it doesn't work properly. What I can do is manually run the code that calls the backend and launches the tabs.

![Running the getLinks command](docs/media/getlinks.png)

Here, the `getLinks` command makes a request for several translations of `melitopol`.

![Tabs all opened and launched](docs/media/launched.png)

Once run, you can see the generated links and the launched tabs.
